# London Transit Busses

From the original [google code][gcode] project:

> LTC Buses shows arrival times for London Transit buses (in London, Ontario, Canada).
It shows arrival times of all buses at a particular stop,
so you don't have to select a route first,
so it's very quick and easy to use.
>
>The release version is [on Google Play][gplay].
>
>To answer the question from a reviewer on the Play store:
this is a home-brew,
just one developer at the moment.
It shows no ads mainly on principle,
but also because I have a good IT job,
and the small amount of extra money I'd earn from in-app ads isn't worth the annoyance to everyone who uses it.
It's just a hobby project.

Please file any bugs [on the GitLab project][gitlab]
